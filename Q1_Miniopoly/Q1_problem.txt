The following “Miniopoly” is a very rough approximation to the game of Monopoly. 
The round board has 40 “squares,” or landing places. 
Squares 0 and 40 are the same; and this square is called “Go.” 
A player starts with $200 on Go, and on each turn, rolls a pair of dice to determine a move, which will be equal to the sum rolled. 
Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 are “follow instructions on card” squares. 
The instructions are receive $50, or $100, or $200 or pay $100 or $150 and are equally likely. 
Squares 0, 10, and 20 are “free”: nothing happens there. 
Square 30 is “Go to jail.” 
Passing or landing on Go pays $200. 
Being in jail means that on one’s turn, if a roll is “doubles” (i.e. two 1’s or two 2’s or ... or two 6’s) then the player “gets out of jail” and moves the value of the doubles from square 10; otherwise, the player pays $10, stays in jail and doesn’t move. 
On any other square, like 29 for instance, pay $29 ( to the “bank,” an infinite source or sink of money). 
If at any time a player’s money falls to $0 or below, that player loses (and the game is over for that player). 

To Do:
Simulate a game of Miniopoly for 20 rolls, or bankruptcy, and observe the amount of money, the fortune, of the player at that time. 
Bankruptcy means fortune equal to or less than $0.
Simulate 10000 games and histogram the fortune
