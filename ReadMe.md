# Question 1
The board has 40 squares, including "Go" (Squares 0 and 40). Players start at Go with $200 and roll dice to move. Certain squares have card instructions, impacting money. Squares 0, 10, and 20 are free; Square 30 is "Go to jail." Bankruptcy occurs if a player's money drops to $0 or below.
The objective is to simulate 10,000 games, recording player fortunes after 20 rolls or bankruptcy; generate a histogram to visualize the distribution of outcomes. 

To run, open the Miniopoly simulation program, specify the number of games (e.g., 10,000), and Run the simulation. View the generated histogram to analyze player fortunes. The simulation reveals the range of player fortunes after 20 rolls or bankruptcy, providing insights into Miniopoly outcomes.

# Question 2 - Part #2
Each of seven dwarfs has his own bed in a common dormitory. Every night, they retire
to bed one at a time, always in the same sequential order. On a particular evening,
the youngest dwarf, who always retires first, has had too much to drink. He randomly
chooses one of the seven beds to fall asleep on. As each of the other dwarfs retires,
he chooses his own bed if it is not occupied, and otherwise randomly chooses another
unoccupied bed. Write a simulation to find for k = 1, 2, . . . , 7, the probability that
the kth dwarf to retire can sleep in his own bed. Simulate 10000000 times to find the
probability.

# Question 3 
The program employs the centered difference method to approximate f'(x) and the trapezoidal rule to approximate the integral. The user is required to input the function f(x), the interval [a,b], and the number of sub-divisions(n).

To run, Input the function f(x), interval [a,b], and the number of sub-divisions (n). Run the program to obtain the arc length.
