# Question 1

# Question 2 - Part #2
Each of seven dwarfs has his own bed in a common dormitory. Every night, they retire
to bed one at a time, always in the same sequential order. On a particular evening,
the youngest dwarf, who always retires first, has had too much to drink. He randomly
chooses one of the seven beds to fall asleep on. As each of the other dwarfs retires,
he chooses his own bed if it is not occupied, and otherwise randomly chooses another
unoccupied bed. Write a simulation to find for k = 1, 2, . . . , 7, the probability that
the kth dwarf to retire can sleep in his own bed. Simulate 10000000 times to find the
probability.
